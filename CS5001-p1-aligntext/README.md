# CS5001 p1

get 18/20

here is feedbacks

Tests

- All 30 public tests passing.
- All 21 private tests passing.

Functionality

- Left, right, centre and signpost alignment all working correctly.

Program design

- Good method decomposition, with functionality broken into smaller pieces.
- Some attempt at breaking down into multiple classes, but these are not really natural object types.  This is okay for this practical, though.

Code quality

- Are @version and @since tags really relevant here?  These perhaps do more harm than good by cluttering the code.
- Good use of meaningful identifiers.
- Good indentation.
- Good use of finals for constants.
- Nice use of Javadoc.
- When documenting lots of finals with short messages as in AlignText.java, you might like to write Javadoc strings on a single line, e.g. /** The keyword for alignment type L. */
